## FAQS
1. why do i need to download the data?  
the data was too large to add to this project.  
In addition, it is good for you to read the disclaimer and understand the source of the file.

2. why write this as a jupyter notebook?  
in a jupyter notebook the user has to open it up and read the notes.  
I wanted to make sure the users understood why I did the calculations I did, and why I did them that way.

3. how to i get this code to run?  
open the VAERS.IPYNB in jupyter notebooks, or any application that supports .IPYNB files. Then Read through the code and run each section.
